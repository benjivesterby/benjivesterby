# Hey All! I'm Benji!

I'm focused on building secure, fault tolerant, distributed systems that incorporate bleeding edge technology such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, as methods for solving difficult problems and creating innovative solutions. A good deal of my work is in creating open source software in these areas that can be used by the community.

## Love for the Go Community

In 2017, I was introduced to the Google Go programming language at a security conference hosted by SANS. Ever since it has become the language I do most of my experimentation with. The language itself is easy to read, and the built in concurrency primitives provide a framework for concurrent design that I did not have in other languages. The language was not the only thing that pulled me in though.

In 2018, I attended my first Gophercon conference. I had been to previous conferences in the .NET community where I worked before 2017, but none of them were like this. The Go community was friendly and welcoming and I immediately felt like I fit in. It is a wonderful group of diverse individuals who all love the Go language, but also strive to maintain an inclusive and welcoming culture.

Being part of the Go community has encouraged me to move towards an open source model whenever possible. To be part of and give back to such a great group of people.
